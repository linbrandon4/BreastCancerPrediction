# Breast Cancer Prediction Model using Logistic Regression

## Data Collection
For the Breast Cancer Prediction Model, I collected a dataset containing various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. The dataset was sourced from a reliable medical research repository. Due to the limited availability of data at the time, the dataset was significantly smaller than ideal for such a complex task. Nonetheless, it provided valuable insights into the potential for predicting breast cancer with machine learning techniques.

## Data Visualization through Heatmaps
To gain a better understanding of the relationships between different features and their impact on the target variable (malignant or benign cancer), I used data visualization techniques, including correlation heatmaps. Despite the small dataset, generating correlation heatmaps allowed me to identify potential strong correlations between certain features and the cancer diagnosis. However, it also revealed the need for a more comprehensive dataset to improve the model's accuracy and generalization.

## Creating the Logistic Regression Model
With the available data, I proceeded to build a Logistic Regression model to predict breast cancer diagnosis. The model was trained and evaluated using standard machine learning practices, including data preprocessing and train-test split. Surprisingly, the model achieved an impressive 99 percent accuracy on the test set. While this result was encouraging, I recognized that the high accuracy could be partly attributed to the small dataset's overfitting.

## Conclusion
Despite the remarkable accuracy achieved by the Logistic Regression model, I acknowledged the importance of obtaining a more extensive and diverse dataset. With a larger dataset, the model could better generalize to unseen samples and potentially discover more subtle patterns associated with breast cancer diagnosis. Therefore, my future plan (if I were to continue this project) involves collaborating with medical institutions to obtain a more comprehensive dataset and exploring other advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble models and deep learning, to further improve the model's performance.
